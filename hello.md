# Hello there!
I'm already pretty familiar with GitHub, but I thought I should at least put something here. My hobbies right now are Monster Hunter World, Linux microkernels, network operations, telecommunications security, and software reverse engineering. I liked this course a lot and it filled in some big gaps in my knowledge, and I am thankful to have taken it.
